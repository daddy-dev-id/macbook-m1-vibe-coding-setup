# Help with MacBook Air display issue (2025-10-21 11:37Z)

_**User (2025-10-21 11:37Z)**_

please check @macbook-air-display-issue-solution.md help me for this

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

I can see you're dealing with a MacBook Air M1 display issue where the LCD is broken but you need to complete an erase process that's currently invisible. Let me help you work through the solutions systematically.

## üö® **IMMEDIATE ACTION - Try Solution 1 First**

Let's start with the key combinations to force external display detection. Try these **one at a time** on your external monitor:

### **Key Combinations to Try:**
1. **`Command + Option + F2`** - Force external display
2. **`Command + Option + F1`** - Switch displays  
3. **`Command + F1`** - Mirror displays
4. **`Command + Option + Control + F2`** - Force external display
5. **`Command + Option + Control + F1`** - Switch displays

**Instructions:**
- Press and hold the key combination
- Wait 2-3 seconds
- Look for any change on external monitor
- Try each combination if previous doesn't work

## üîç **What to Look For:**
- Any flicker or change on the external monitor
- The erase process becoming visible
- Any system response or display switching

## üìã **Next Steps Based on Results:**

**If Solution 1 works:**
- You should see the erase process on your external monitor
- Complete the erase and proceed with setup

**If Solution 1 fails:**
- We'll move to Solution 2 (restart recovery mode with external display priority)
- This involves a complete restart but should force external display detection

**If both fail:**
- Solution 3 (Target Disk Mode) using your MacBook Pro to control the MacBook Air

## ‚è∞ **Timeline:**
- **Now:** Try key combinations (5 minutes)
- **If needed:** Restart recovery mode (10 minutes)
- **Erase process:** 30-60 minutes
- **Setup:** 15 minutes

**Please try the key combinations now and let me know what happens!** Even if you don't see immediate results, any response (flicker, change, etc.) will help us determine the next step.

i already did, but stil doesnt resolved
can you connect shell using apple configurator? refer to attached

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

I can see you're using Apple Configurator 2 and it's currently in the "Downloading System" phase (Step 2 of 4). This is actually a good sign - it means the system restore process is working, but you're not seeing it on your external monitor.

## üîß **Apple Configurator 2 Shell Access**

Yes, you can access the shell through Apple Configurator 2! Here's how:

### **Method 1: Console Access (Current View)**
You're already in the Console view. Look for:
- **Terminal/Shell option** in the Console section
- **Command line access** button
- **SSH connection** option

### **Method 2: Enable Developer Mode**
1. In Apple Configurator 2, go to **View** ‚Üí **Show Console**
2. Look for **"Enable Developer Mode"** or **"Shell Access"**
3. This will give you terminal access to the MacBook Air

### **Method 3: SSH Connection**
1. In the Console view, look for **"SSH"** or **"Remote Access"**
2. Enable SSH if available
3. Connect using: `ssh admin@[MacBook-Air-IP]`

## üö® **Current Status Check**

Since you're in Step 2 of 4 (Downloading System), the process is actually working! The issue is just display visibility.

### **What's Happening:**
- ‚úÖ System restore is in progress
- ‚úÖ Apple Configurator 2 is controlling the process
- ‚ùå External monitor not showing the process

## üéØ **Immediate Actions**

### **Option 1: Wait and Monitor**
- Let the current process complete (Step 2 of 4)
- The restore should work even without visible display
- Monitor progress in Apple Configurator 2

### **Option 2: Force Display Switch via Configurator**
1. In Apple Configurator 2, look for **"Display Settings"** or **"Video Output"**
2. Try to force external display detection
3. Look for **"Mirror Display"** or **"External Display"** options

### **Option 3: Shell Access for Display Commands**
If you can get shell access:
```bash
# Force external display
sudo pkill -f WindowServer
# Or try display switching commands
```

## ‚è∞ **Timeline Update**
- **Current:** Step 2 of 4 (Downloading System) - let this complete
- **Next:** Step 3 of 4 (Installing System)
- **Final:** Step 4 of 4 (Setup)

**The good news is the restore is working!** The display issue is just cosmetic at this point. Let the process complete and see if the external monitor shows the final setup screen.

Would you like me to help you find the shell access options in Apple Configurator 2, or should we wait for the current restore process to complete?
