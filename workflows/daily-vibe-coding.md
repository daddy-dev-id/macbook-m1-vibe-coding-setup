## üéµ Vibe Coding Principles

### Flow State Maintenance
- **Eliminate Distractions:** Close unnecessary apps, notifications off
- **Single Focus:** One task at a time, complete before moving on
- **Optimal Environment:** Comfortable, well-lit, quiet space
- **Regular Breaks:** Every 90 minutes, respect the rhythm

### Sustainable Pace
- **Quality over Speed:** Better to do less well than more poorly
- **Listen to Your Body:** Take breaks when needed
- **Celebrate Small Wins:** Acknowledge progress regularly
- **Learn from Mistakes:** Each error is a learning opportunity

### Continuous Learning
- **Daily Learning:** At least 1 hour of structured learning
- **Document Everything:** Keep notes of insights and discoveries
- **Share Knowledge:** Help others while reinforcing your own learning
- **Stay Curious:** Ask questions, explore new approaches

## üöÄ Emergency Recovery

### When Things Go Wrong
1. **Stop and Breathe:** Take a 5-minute break
2. **Assess the Situation:** What's the actual problem?
3. **Use Available Tools:** Check monitoring scripts, logs
4. **Ask for Help:** Use communities, documentation
5. **Document the Issue:** For future reference
6. **Move Forward:** Don't let one problem derail the day

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **System Slow:** Run cleanup script, check memory usage
- **Environment Issues:** Recreate conda environment
- **Task Confusion:** Review task list, break down complex tasks
- **Motivation Low:** Take a longer break, review goals
